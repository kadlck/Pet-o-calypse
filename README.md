# Pet-o-calypse

**Work in Progress**

Just a silly little idea I'm working on. It has some skeleton and idea of what I want inside.

## To-Do List in random order

1. **Databases Setup**  
   - Ensure all database models and relationships are properly set up.

2. **Pet Functions**  
   - Check core pet functions during events

3. **Apocalypse & Events**  
   - Make the apocalypse and event systems fully functional (it currently has some bits and pieces).

4. **Finish Pet Picture Generation**  
   - Generate the final pet images and use them instead of the hamster

5. **Delete Pet Functionality**  
   - Ensure users can delete their pets from their profiles.

6. **Visuals**  
   - Add more styling and visual elements to the front-end.

7. **User Buffs**  
   - Double-check the implementation of user buffs and make sure they're working as intended.

8. **Rewards & Accomplishments**  
   - Add rewards and accomplishment systems for users.

9. **Pet Retirement System**  
   - Implement a pet retirement feature (connected with rewards/points).

10. **Minigames**  
   - Develop and add mini-games (e.g., Whack-a-Zombie).

11. **Pet Feuds**  
   - Add pet feuds to annoy the user.

12. **Random Events for Rewards**  
   - Introduce random events that give rewards (e.g., ways_to_die generator).

13. **Special Event for Cats & Rabbits each**  
   - Implement special event specific to cats in revolution and rabbits in zombie.
